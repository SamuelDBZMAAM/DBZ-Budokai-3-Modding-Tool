Thank you for using the Budokai Modding Tool!

In this version (0.10, BTB edition), there are new features as well as updates to old ones:

Previous:
------------
YOU CAN NOW ADD A CUSTOM SHADER VALUE! Meaning that
-- B4 01 lines can now be converted to be shadable with a shader of your choice and
-- Converted B1 models can now have a custom shader number that is fitting of your character model

There is now a change in how you insert the files into the tool, you can now type in the full extension of your model without having to change it to a .bin file first

Various grammatic and logic fixes

Removed Herobrine

Various stats shown in the conversion (you can see how many model parts have been converted and such with the shader number chosen)
-- You can choose to not show the stats and offsets of each change made in the model if it is too much for you however

B3 to B1 conversions (for those of you who like the cutscenes as much as I do :P)
-- B4 01 parts are made to be blacked out when shown in B1 (unless I can find the right value which converts them to be shown correctly)

AMT Creation/Editing, you can now create an AMT which has shaders (64x64 with 256 colours) and textures (256x256 with 256 colours) with more options coming soon

Aura editing, you can now replace the aura order in characters (mix Kaioken aura and SSJ4 aura for example) with more options and features coming soon

------------

New AMB combiner, you can now place B1/IW AMO and AMT into an AMB, ready for any B2 or B3 gameplay! :D
New "Tutorial.txt" file added to help for a runthrough on the program

Extra Notes:

Your Anti Virus may come up claiming this to be a virus but I can assure you that is not, make this tool an exception and you will be able to use it freely!
